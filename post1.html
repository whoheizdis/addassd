			        <h1 class="post-title">The Age Where Everything Felt Temporary</h1>
				    <h2 class="post-info">By Helena Marie B. Samson || <span class="date">Published: 01/02/2026 at 08:08 am</span></h2>

				    <p class="post-p"> 
					    <span class="first">T</span>here was an age in my life where everything felt like it was on borrowed time. 
					    Friendships were intense but short-lived, dreams shifted overnight, and nothing felt stable enough to hold onto. 
					    I learned early not to expect permanence because the moment I did, something always slipped away. 
					    It was easier to pretend I didn’t care than to admit how deeply I wanted things to last.
					</p>
					<p class="post-p">
					    At that time, I thought detachment was maturity. 
						I convinced myself that keeping people at a distance made me stronger. 
						I didn’t stay too long, didn’t speak too honestly, and didn’t let myself hope too much. 
						Everything was treated as temporary—relationships, happiness, even versions of myself. 
						I was always preparing for the ending instead of living in the moment.
					</p>
					<p class="post-p">
					    Looking back, I realize how exhausting that mindset was. 
						Living as if everything is temporary means you’re constantly bracing for loss. 
						You don’t fully celebrate what you have because you’re already mourning what’s coming next. 
						That age taught me how to survive, but it also taught me how easy it is to miss the beauty of something while you’re busy protecting yourself.
					</p>
					<p class="post-p">
					    Now, I understand that not everything is meant to last—and that’s okay. 
						Some things exist only to teach us, shape us, and prepare us for what comes next. 
						Temporary doesn’t mean meaningless. That age may be over, but the lessons it gave me will stay.
